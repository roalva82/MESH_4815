# MESH_4815
MESH model for Alberta Census Division No. 15 (shapefile ID 4815)

Division No. 15 corresponds to the upper catchments starting from the Rocky Mountains. It encompass an area roughly between Canmore and Jasper. For details about this area see maps in: https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/2c4ab1d1-46a7-49f6-a1b0-a19182a0a636/resource/56f83c81-221c-412e-b008-a8130fded49b/download/map-series-alberta-census-divisions.pdf

The model is a subdivision of the Alberta provincial territory, and it is intended to be used as a testbed for model calibration. We will start by calibrating the subbasin with ID 71037856 extracted from the Merit Hydro Basins. This subbasin is located upstream of the city of Longview, about 70 km southwest of Calgary. The subbasin is particularly suitable due to the presence of the station from the Water Survey of Canada (WSC) with ID 05BL027.
